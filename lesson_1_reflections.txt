How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The results are narrowed down to only the lines in the two different files that have either been added, deleted or modified in some way

2 ---------
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having entire file history access can highlight repetitive mistakes that I make while coding.

3 ----------
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Automatic commits prevent you from correcting you own mistakes when you see them whereas manual commits allow you to not save a mistake before you correct it.

4 ---------
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I think this allows for faster project development during the coding process where as Google Docs and other programs that save automatically were not specifically intended for production coding environments.

5 ---------
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git diff highlights differences between two or three files, only whereas git log displays recent changes for all files.

6 ---------
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    With version control you have confidence that you can always go back to the last good code version that you saved in case you make a mistake. 

7 ---------
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to try using Git to update a lot of previous course coding projects so that they are better represented in my GitHub repositories.
